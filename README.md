# 99.7% Citric Liquid

Base code for CC3002's *99.7% Citric Juice* Project.

The project consists in creating a (simplified) clone of the game **100% Orange Juice**
developed by [Orange_Juice](http://daidai.moo.jp) and distributed by 
[Fruitbat Factory](https://fruitbatfactory.com).

The initial phase of development was to create the principal classes and methods
we're going to need to define this game. This was, creating the players, the enemies,
the panels, and the rules of the game.

Additionally, I created the tests to see if everything's going alright.
